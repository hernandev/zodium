# Zodium

**Zodium** is an object-oriented wrapper for the `libsodium` bindings of PHP.

The name **Z**odium is due the fact of this extension being developed with [Zephir](https://zephir-lang.com/).

The original [sodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium-php) extension is still required, Zodium does not
bind the C library, it wrapps the existing non-OOP bindings into an OOP API.
